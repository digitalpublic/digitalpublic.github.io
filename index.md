title: "Introducing Digital Public: **a transition plan for open data and civic tech**."
---
The world’s first digital civic trustee, Digital Public stewards data and code in the public’s interest, protected by a legal trust. 

Trusts are important because they ensure that no matter the steward, they have a fiduciary duty to keep their promises, protect the trust, and serve the public’s interest. It also means that if the Digital Public—or any trustee—goes under, its successor has to uphold the same promises and public interest. 

This feature is unique to trusts: neither companies nor governments preserve the public’s interest in data in the same, permanent way. Companies get bought or go under. Governments change administrations and priorities. When this happens, the people who relied on government or corporate promises get left behind. But trusts are one of the world’s oldest and proven ways to ensure good governance of public assets. Digital civic trusts are designed to build open governance of the data and code that our public institutions and services increasingly rely on. 

We start today. We’re working with a network of advocates, technologists, archivists, and users to support the upkeep and maintenance of the foundations of our digital public spaces. Our first project is to support the organizations archiving, hosting, and relying on the US Government data taken down by the incoming administration. Our hope is that by focusing on the users and demand for data, we can begin to prioritize—and maybe even revive—the continuing production and maintenance of datasets that underpin our democracy.
